daac-tools Code of Conduct
===============================

Be considerate.
---------------

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any
decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should take those consequences into
account when making decisions. Even if it's not obvious at the time, our contributions will impact
the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, documentation, and
translations during a release may negatively impact others' work.

Be respectful.
--------------

The daac-tools community and members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable
contribution to daac-tools. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot
allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the
daac-tools community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people
outside the daac-tools project.

When we disagree, we consult others.
------------------------------------

Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time, and the daac-tools community is no
exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and
with the help of the community and community processes. We have places available to facilitate
discussion, and these places help to decide the right course for daac-tools. When our goals differ
dramatically, we encourage the creation of alternative projects so that the community can test new
ideas and contribute to the discussion.

When we are unsure, we ask for help.
------------------------------------

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the daac-tools community. Asking
questions avoids many problems down the road, so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked
questions should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be taken to
do so in an appropriate forum.

Step down considerately.
------------------------

Members of every project come and go, and daac-tools is no different. When somebody leaves or
disengages from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that they do so in a way that minimizes
disruption to the project. This means they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper
steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.
