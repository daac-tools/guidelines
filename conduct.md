daac-tools Code of Conduct
==========================

Be considerate
--------------

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any
decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making
decisions.

Be respectful
-------------

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good
intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We donâ€™t allow frustration to turn into
a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive
one.

Take responsibility for our words and our actions
-------------------------------------------------

We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed
or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.

Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus
-----------------------------------------

Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester
leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.We expect participants in the project to resolve
disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with
designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.

Ask for help when unsure
------------------------

Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems
later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who
are asked should be responsive and helpful.

Step down considerately
-----------------------

When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises
disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to
ensure that others can pick up where they left off.
